# Drewseffi's Bet Calculator

## Overview
I have experience working in a bookmakers and learning to calculate bets can be quite challenging and I think that a lot of the calulators online are over-complicated and ugly. My main goal is to create a clean and functional bet calculator that I would want to use. This would also be my first time using JavaScript for web development and I think this is a fun and engaging way to learn this skill. This project will be one that I think I will work on for a while with multiple iterations as I improve my skills in CSS and JavaScript, however, once I have reached a functional and aesthetic state I will be leaving this project to pursue others. This is a project that I will be working on between working on my other projects that I have on-going and planned.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

I want this website to work with pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As I am new to web dev I don't want to dive into jQuery as I want to build a strong foundation in JavaScript first. This is the same reason I am not using a technology like React or Vue.

I was using a few different web based bet calculators to get some inspiration how I wanted my website to look and to function. They are here below to see what else other people have been making.
